## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains a Test Automation Framework, built using Cypress and Javascript for automated testing for this site: https://www.saucedemo.com/

## 🚀 Key Features
This Cypress project is designed for robust end-to-end testing, incorporating best practices and advanced features to enhance test automation efficiency.
- ✅ Page Object Model (POM) – Organized test structure using reusable page classes to improve maintainability.
- ✅ Data-Driven Testing – Uses external test data for login credentials and other scenarios, ensuring flexibility and scalability.
- ✅ Custom Commands – Encapsulates frequently used actions like login to reduce redundancy and improve readability.
- ✅ Advanced Module Integrations:
   - XPath Support – Enables selecting elements using XPath.
   - Cross-Environment Configuration – Allows testing across multiple environments (e.g., production & development) by dynamically setting the base URL.
   - Integrated browserstack
   - Used faker.js to load random data dynamically
   - Screenshots & Videos – Automatically captures test evidence for debugging and reporting.
   - Retries on Failures – Configured retries to improve test stability.
   - Test Grouping with Grep – Supports running specific test groups using Cypress grep.
- ✅ Custom Scripts – Optimized package.json scripts for running tests across different browsers, environments, and headless modes.
- ✅ Mochawesome Reporting – Generates detailed, interactive HTML reports with screenshots and logs for better test analysis.
- ✅ CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions:
   - Runs tests automatically on every push & pull request.
   - Scheduled execution Monday to Friday at noon (UTC).
   - Supports manual test execution triggers via GitHub Actions workflow.
